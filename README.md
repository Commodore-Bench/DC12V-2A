Please excuse the lousy picture. But unfortunately my ######## high-tech #### phone for over 1000 euros has such a ####### camera.... :-)



## DC converter for 12V in TO-3 format

This DC converter is the twin brother of [this 5V version](https://github.com/DL2DW/DC5V-2A) I had already uploaded here on GitHub recently. These serve among other things as a replacement for the Commodore 1541 floppy. On the one hand the current consumption decreases and as a consequence less power is converted into heat. This keeps the inside of the floppy drive much cooler.



# Technical

A switching regulator from Texas Instruments in the form of the TPS54332DDAR was used. On the one hand, this is exactly what I needed in terms of data, it is inexpensive and easy to install.

I designed the converter to handle 12V with a continuous load of 2A. 

The DC Converter can easily replace, for example, the well-known 7812 in TO-3 format, but still has enough reserve.

I once created a 3D image, because I unfortunately could not get sharp photos.

The 1541 draws up to 800mA under 12V, depending on the activity. The controller itself is designed for 2A, but can easily handle 3A for a short time. 

Under full load, that is 2A the ripple still looks pretty good in my opinion. I tested this with a resistive load (load resistors).

# BOM

Here is the parts list for the DC converter. Of course you don't have to use exactly these brands. However, I give to note that comparison types, especially if they have a somewhat poorer quality, can have a negative effect on the ripple.
